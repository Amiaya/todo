I installed nodemailer
using the command npm i nodemailer

I required it in my project, in the utils folder and named the file email.js

i created a transport, defined the email options and send the email to a gmail.

to be able to do all of that, had to go to my google account and turn on the 2-step verification to be able to generate a password for my app.
